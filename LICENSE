## Summary

- **Frontend** (`/frontend`): MIT License - permissive, allows commercial use
- **Backend** (`/backend`): AGPL-3.0 - copyleft, requires source disclosure for network use

## Important Notes

1. If you use only the frontend code and replace the backend with your own implementation, only the MIT license applies.

2. If you use the backend code (even as a service), you must:
   - Disclose your source code
   - License it under AGPL-3.0
   - Preserve copyright notices
   - State changes made to the code

3. The Swiss Ephemeris library used by the backend has its own licensing terms for commercial use.
